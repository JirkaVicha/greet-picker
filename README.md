###Greet-Picker
This app is like a tool for learning how to greet people in different languages. It displays a list of languages, and when you click on one, it shows you the corresponding greeting in that language. At the top, there's a heading explaining what the app does, and below it, there's a box showing the currently selected greeting in a large font size. You can click on different languages to see how to say "hello" in each one. It's a fun way to explore different languages and cultures!
